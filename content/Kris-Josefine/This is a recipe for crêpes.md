## Steps
1. Whip flour and milk to a lump-free batter and then add and whip one egg at a time. Mix in the salt and let the batter sit for about 30 minutes.
2. Heat up a frying pan and put a little bit of butter for the first batch. The batter makes for 4 crêpes. Use approximately 1/2 dl for one crêpe.
3. Whip the cream and cut the banana into pieces.

## Serving instructions
1. Put the wipped cream, banana and the nutella inside the crêpe and fold it up.
2. Serve immediately (otherwise the cream will melt and lose its fluffiness).


## ENJOY!
